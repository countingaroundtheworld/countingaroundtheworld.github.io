			<br><h2>Welcome to Counting Around the World.</h2>
			<p>Numbers are counted differently in parts of the world.
			This is because of the language spoken and the writing style used are not the same in most of the countries.
			There are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish and hundreds more that we could learn.</p>
			<p>Counting Around the World is provided by UiTM's Faculty of Information Management to show how numbers are counted in different languages.
			Lets start by choosing from one of the activities in the menu above. There are flipcards, printables, and video clips that you may refer to.</p>
